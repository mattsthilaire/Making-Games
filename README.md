# Making-Games
I am become interested in games. Builder of games. Will start with extremely basic text and type game and then go into building a shitty engine....then maybe a good one.....probably not though. Probably just shitty.

UPDATE: I messed up and deleted a Snake games I built, a maze game I built, and a simple text based game I built...gotta rebuild and build back better. Never quit.
UPDATE 2: Found 'em baaaaabbbbbbby.
